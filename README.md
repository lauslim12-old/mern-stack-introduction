# MERN Stack Architecture
Repository for my tutorial on how to set up your first MERN Stack architecture. The written tutorial is still in progress by me!

## Architecture and Philosophies
* (M)ariaDB / (M)ongoDB
* (E)xpress JS
* (R)eact JS
* (N)ode JS

## Design Architecture
For rapid application development, I use Bootstrap with standard React.js color theme.

## About MERN Stack
This is an introduction to MERN Stack for people who are unfamiliar with the concept. I use MariaDB as another way to pronounce the "M" word. The reason is because nowadays, it is still a market requirement to use a relational database. Utilizing MongoDB is also possible - and I will make this repository into two versions. One with MariaDB, and the other with MongoDB.

## Dependencies
* Axios
* Body Parser
* Bootstrap
* CORS
* Dotenv
* Express.js
* MariaDB
* React.js
* Sequelize

## Features
* As this is a basic yet powerful tutorial, I will be taking Angular's material: CRUD'ing a Todo app.
* Create a Todo
* Read a Todo
* Update a Todo
* Delete a Todo

## Installations and Usage
* First, do `git clone repo` to fetch it to your local machine.
* Use your command line to `cd repo-path`. Make sure to open two command lines, one for the front-end, and one for the back-end.
* Change the `backend/.env.example` variables to any of your webserver setup. Then, rename it to `.env`.
* Finally, use `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
* Profit!
